immersion
=========

when you're watching a video tutorial for a programming language, you should be able to pause, modify the code, run the modified code to see what happens, rearrange windows, download versions of the code at discrete timestamps, etc.

## notes n' stuff
- [ ] maybe plugs in to text editors/IDE's? or create one in the web browser, but that means you'll lose a lot of things (like snippets & autocomplete)
